Challenges we faced - 
We faced difficutly as we have never written a code like this before. We had to wwatch tutorials and read on website to figure out how to create buttons and table in windows. It took a lot of patience and hard work to complete this project. While working on this, we learnt a lot of new and amazing concepts. This project was worth all the time that we put into it.
